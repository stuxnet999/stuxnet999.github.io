## Challenge Description

![Challenge Description](/images/CTF/HackTM/RR/challenge-description.png)

The challenge file can be downloaded from [Google-Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hPBksCtm3a4wGs9cd8DYkM4mcV0aNCEJ
) or [Mega-Drive](https://mega.nz/#!1MEQRCpD!YfSQZQSmKn520Jh8DCBb2Xh0ndqF_kPjgZsQIYtvH8A).

## Initial Analysis

When I downloaded the files, I observed that one of the images had no data in it. Also, the description provides us with information that one of the drives was lost. So I obviously concluded that the challenge involved RAID recovery.

The concept of RAID recovery is quite simple. You can simply obtain/recover the lost drive by **`xoring`** the others and rebuilding the RAID files might give me the flag. So let us get into it.

## XORing the images

As you can see in the image below, the drive `2.img` has been lost. So we have to XOR `1.img` and `3.img` to recover the original image.

For this, I used a simple tool called [XorFiles](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/xorfiles.html)

Using this tool, I Xor-ed `1.img`, `3.img` and obtained the new file.

## Carving out the JPEG

I initially thought of rebuilding the whole image, mounting it and then accessing the flag. However, I did not do that. I observed the hexdump of the file and found a JPEG image header.

So I knew just what to do. I simply used `dd` to carve out the file from the offset.

$ dd if=new.img of=flag.jpg skip=69476332

Well, the offset I used had some extra bytes at the start so we can simply remove till we get the start of the valid JPEG file signature.

## Flag

After deleting the extra bytes at the start and opening the new image in any image viewer gives us the flag

**FLAG**: HackTM{1bf965b6e23e5d2cb4bdfa67b6d8b0940b5a23e98b8593bb96a4261fb8a1f66a}
